This is an app, using asynchronous code to fetch data from 
  OpenWeatherMap api. Functionality is straightforward, we have
  to enter the city name in the search field, the app then takes
  that input.value and searches the API for that city name.
  If we get the response, the data is then rendered on the DOM.
  If we get a rejection, an error message is alerted.

Version 1 took about 6 hours to finish. The hardest part to make
  was figuring out the API functionality and how to set the fetch
  request. other than that, most of the time was spent on styling.
